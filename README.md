# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Taiyou! 

## Game Designer/Developer Feats:
- I'm currently working on my personal project as a Project Lead at [Gensokyo Reimagined](https://www.gensokyoreimagined.net/).
    - Focusing on Team Management, Feature Implementation, Level Design and Asset Creation (Modelling, Texturing and Some Animations)

- Can create Realistic and Fantasy themed terrain using World Machine and Gaea; some examples can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/l7fT7ch)
- I've written many documentation about tracking the progress on the other art/modeling/music teams. An example can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/ysp4LhR)
- TODO: Expand more

## Developer Feats:
- I am mostly a Java, Python, C# and C++ Developer, however I work with a variety of other languages when required. For example to edit shaders and such, I have picked up OpenGL as well as tiny bit of Vulkan.

- I consider myself mostly a Back-End Developer (MySQL/SQL) although i have a decent amount of knowledge on Front-End (HTML/CSS/JS) as well.

- I also have experience with TensorFlow 2 and friends (Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib) for machine learning and currently learning PyTorch
